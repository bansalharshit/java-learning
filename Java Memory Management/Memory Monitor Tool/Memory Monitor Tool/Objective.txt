1.Create a tool that monitors heap and stack memory usage in real-time,using java's MemoryMXBean and GarbageCollectorMXBean APIs.

2.The tool should log garbage collection events and display memory consumption trends.
=======================================================

Heap & Non-Heap Monitoring
1.getHeapMemoryUsage() tracks live heap usage.
2.getNonHeapMemoryUsage() tracks stack/metaspace usage.

Garbage Collection Stats
1. Uses GarbageCollectionMXBean to log GC runs,count,and time spent.

Real-Time Logging
1.Memory Logged every 3 seconds.(this time you can adjust according to your requirement)
2.GC stats logged every 10 seconds.(this time you can adjust according to your requirement)

Workload Simulation
Continuously Allocates memory to trigger GC Events for testing.

Remark-> we can use Java Management Extensions(JMX) to monitor memory in real time.

Actual Use of this Application in real-world
1.Performance Monitoring tools(like VisualVm or JConsole).
2.Microservices memory health dashboards.
3.Detecting Memory Leaks in production.

2. Key Concepts You’re Demonstrating
Heap Memory

Stores objects created via new.

GC works here to clean unused objects.

Monitored using MemoryMXBean.getHeapMemoryUsage().

Non-Heap Memory

Includes Metaspace (class metadata) and Thread Stack.

Tracked via MemoryMXBean.getNonHeapMemoryUsage().

Garbage Collection (GC) Events

Using GarbageCollectorMXBean to check:

How many times GC ran.

How much time GC took.

Thread Scheduling

Using ScheduledExecutorService to log data periodically.

E) Workload Simulation
byte[] memoryFiller = new byte[10 * 1024 * 1024]; // Allocate 10MB
Forces heap growth → GC runs → realistic behavior.

5. How can you detect Memory Leaks using such a tool?
Clue of memory leaks: Heap usage keeps increasing over time without going down after GC.

Steps:

Track used heap via MemoryMXBean.

Observe GC events via GarbageCollectorMXBean.

If heap doesn’t drop even after multiple GC runs → possible leak.

How to Explain This in an Interview (One-Liner):
“This tool uses JMX APIs to monitor JVM memory in real-time. It separates Heap and Non-Heap analysis, tracks GC stats, and could be extended to detect leaks or trigger alerts. I used ScheduledExecutorService for periodic logging and MemoryMXBean for granular memory insights.”


Question1.Whose Memory Usage Are We Tracking?
Answer 
“The tool I built monitors the heap and GC stats of the JVM process it’s running in. It doesn’t track OS-level or cross-process memory. But it can be extended with remote JMX access to monitor external JVMs.”
