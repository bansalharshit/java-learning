1.Build an online store using OOPS principles where users can browse items,add items to the cart, and make purches.

2.Implement product categories,and inheritance between Electronics,Clothing,and other categories.

3.Include constructors to initialize objects and overloaded methods for different payents types.

=============================================
Understood. Let’s outline **the approach first** so the structure is clear before coding:

---

### **Approach for Online Store (OOP-Focused)**

#### **1. Core Classes**

1. **Product (Base Class)**

   * Fields: `id`, `name`, `price`
   * Methods: `toString()`, `getDetails()`
   * Used for polymorphism when handling multiple product types.

2. **Electronics, Clothing, etc. (Subclasses)**

   * Inherit from `Product`
   * Add category-specific fields (e.g., `brand` for Electronics, `size` for Clothing)
   * Override `getDetails()` to display extra info.

---

#### **2. User and Cart**

1. **User**

   * Fields: `name`, `cart`
   * Methods: `addToCart(Product)`, `viewCart()`, `checkout()`.

2. **Cart**

   * Holds a list of `Product`.
   * Methods: `addProduct()`, `removeProduct()`, `calculateTotal()`.

---

#### **3. Payment (Overloading)**

* Overload `checkout()` to handle:

  * `checkout(String creditCardNumber)`
  * `checkout(String upiId, String pin)`
  * `checkout(CashOnDelivery)` (simply a flag).

---

#### **4. Store**

* Holds a **list of products**.
* Methods:

  * `displayProducts()`
  * `searchProduct(String name)`
  * `browseByCategory(Class<?> type)`.

---

#### **5. Console Flow**

1. Display product categories.
2. Let the user browse, search, and add to cart.
3. Perform checkout with chosen payment method.

---

### **OOP Concepts Applied**

1. **Inheritance** → Product → Electronics / Clothing.
2. **Polymorphism** → Treat all products uniformly when added to the cart.
3. **Encapsulation** → Private fields + getters/setters.
4. **Abstraction** → Interfaces if needed (e.g., `Payable` for payment methods).
5. **Constructors** → Initialize products and users.
6. **Method Overloading** → Multiple payment options.
7. **`toString()` Override** → Display details clearly.
8. **`final` and `static`** → Constants (e.g., store name, tax rate).
9. **`super`** → Call parent constructors.

========================================================================================
Step 1: Product Hierarchy (OOP Basics)
We’ll create:

Product (base class)

Electronics and Clothing (subclasses with extra fields)

What This Demonstrates
Inheritance: Electronics and Clothing extend Product.

Polymorphism: Both override getDetails(), but we call them via Product reference.

Constructors: Parent initialized with super().

toString() override: Clean printing of objects.
============================================================================================
Step 2: Cart & User
Now we’ll add:

Cart – to hold selected products and calculate totals.

User – to represent a shopper who interacts with the cart.

What This Adds
Encapsulation: Cart manages its own product list privately.

Composition: User has a Cart (not inheritance but “has-a” relationship).

Behavior: Adding/removing products dynamically.

Reusability: Cart logic can work for any user.
===========================================================================================
Step 3: Checkout & Payment (Method Overloading)
We now add:

Checkout logic in User.

Overloaded methods for different payment types:

Credit/Debit card

UPI

Cash on Delivery.

What We Achieved Here
Method Overloading: Multiple checkout() methods based on payment type.

Encapsulation: processPayment() kept private inside User.

Polymorphism: Product references handle both Electronics & Clothing seamlessly.

Clean Flow: After successful payment, the cart clears.

==============================================================================================
Step 4: Store with Product Browsing, Search & Dynamic Input
Now we make the application console-based and interactive:

Store class to hold all products and allow browsing/search.

Scanner for dynamic user input.

User can:

View all products

Search by name

Add to cart

Checkout with chosen payment method

What We Achieved in Step 4
Dynamic Input: User interacts via console.

Search & Browse: Products can be searched by ID or viewed all at once.

Polymorphism: Same cart handles Electronics and Clothing seamlessly.

Method Overloading: Multiple payment methods handled cleanly.

Encapsulation & Composition: Store manages products, User manages cart.
